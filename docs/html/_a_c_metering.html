<div class="textblock"><p>Here we will introduce the key concepts of the AC metering unit as a system/product.</p>
<p>The purpose of this material is to introduce the key concepts, allowing a reader to venture into the ether and find more information on these topics themselves.</p>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="VoltageSensing"></a>
Voltage Sensing</h1>
<p>Voltage sensing is the process of measuring the voltage between two points in an electrical system. <br  />
 In single-phase AC metering, this is typically <b>live to neutral</b> and is known as <b>phase voltage</b>. <br  />
 In multi-phase systems, it is common to measure <b>line-to-line voltages</b>, referred to as <b>line voltages</b>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the goal of the voltage sensing circuit is to:</p><ul>
<li>Scale the input mains voltage (e.g. 230 V RMS) to a safe and measurable level for the ADC.</li>
<li>Maintain a <b>linear, phase-accurate</b>, and <b>low-noise</b> signal path.</li>
</ul>
<p>By far the most commmon method for voltage sensing is to use a <b>resistive (potential) divider</b> to scale the voltage to a safe range for input to the ADC.<br  />
</p>

<div class="caption">
Voltage Sensing</div></div>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>With the AC signal centered around zero, a common set of errors can occur due to signal biases.<br  />
 These biases can be introduced intentionally, such as using an ADC reference voltage (or Vref/2) as a bias point.<br  />
 Or unintentionally, such as offset errors from PGA's (programmable gain amplifiers) or ADC's.<br  />
 This is where filtering considerations are required to remove DC components from the signal<br  />
 Generally speaking a HPF (high pass filter) will always be used to remove these DC components (biases) from the signal.<br  />
 This actually becomes a design benefit because this allows a system, ADC or amplifier designer to allow a for poorer performance in bias/offset errors, understanding that in the end system these will be compensated for using a HPF.<br  />
 This allows the design and selection of ADC's with accuracy focus on the areas that matter most, such as noise rejection.</dd></dl>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="LineFrequency"></a>
Line Frequency</h1>
<p>Line frequency refers to the <b>fundamental AC system frequency</b>, typically <b>50 Hz or 60 Hz</b>, depending on regional standards. <br  />
 Accurate line frequency measurement is important for:</p><ul>
<li>Power quality monitoring.</li>
<li>Synchronisation of power measurements.</li>
<li>Detection of abnormal supply conditions (e.g. under-frequency or over-frequency events).</li>
</ul>
<p>Frequency is a quality indicator of the above grid health due to strict frequency gaurantees by national supply operators - for example the UK National Grid gaurantees +/-1% deviation from 50Hz, though normal operating conditions are often much more accurate.<br  />
</p>
<p>This makes intuitive sense when thinking of the supply side, for example when a large generator gets overloaded its operation will slow or even stall - the speed of which is directly proportional to the frequency on the grid.<br  />
 Therefore accurate frequency measurement is quite a common requirements, specifically noteable in EV chargers.</p>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="CurrentSensing"></a>
Current Sensing</h1>
<p>Current sensing is the process of converting line current into a measurable voltage signal for the ADC subsystem. <br  />
 The sensing element must provide a <b>linear, phase-accurate</b>, and <b>low-noise</b> representation of the true current waveform.<br  />
 In this section we will look at common current sensing techniques in AC metering.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Please also see the note on biases in the voltage sensing section, this also applies to current sensing.</dd></dl>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Shunt"></a>
Shunt</h2>
<p>A <b>shunt resistor</b> is a precision low-ohmic resistor placed in series with the current path. <br  />
 The voltage drop across the resistor is proportional to current by Ohm’s law:   </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[    V_\mathrm{shunt} = I_\mathrm{line} \cdot R_\mathrm{shunt} 
\]
</p>
<table class="markdownTable">
<tr class="markdownTableHead">
<th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Advantages</b>  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Disadvantages</b>  </th></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">- High accuracy and linearity <br  />

 - Tamper resistant  </td><td class="markdownTableBodyNone">- No galvanic isolation <br  />
 - Power dissipation increases with current <br  />
 - Must be placed carefully to avoid thermal drift and EMI coupling  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Shunts are most common in <b>low-cost single-phase</b> or <b>direct-connected meters</b>.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="CT"></a>
CT (Current Transformer)</h2>
<p>A <b>current transformer (CT)</b> provides galvanic isolation between the line and measurement circuit. <br  />
 It works on the principle of magnetic induction, where the line current through the primary winding induces a proportional current in the secondary winding:   </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[    I_\mathrm{secondary} = \frac{I_\mathrm{primary}}{N} 
\]
</p>
<p> Where \( N \) is the turns ratio.<br  />
 This secondary current is then converted to a voltage through a burden resistor and filter network to be fed into an ADC.</p>

<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">- Provides isolation and safety <br  />

</table>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Rogowski"></a>
Rogowski Coil</h2>
<p>A <b>Rogowski coil</b> is an air-cored current sensor that measures the rate of change of current:   </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[    V_\mathrm{rogowski} = -N \frac{d\phi}{dt} 
\]
</p>
<p> Where \( \phi \) is the magnetic flux and this can actually be rewritten as:   </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[    V_\mathrm{rogowski} = - \frac{\mu N A}{2 \pi r} (\frac{dI}{dt})
\]
</p>
<p> Where:</p><ul>
<li>\( \mu \) = Magnetic permeability</li>
<li>\( N \) = Number of coil windings</li>
<li>\( A \) = Area of the coil</li>
<li>\( r \) = Distance from the conductor to the coil centre</li>
<li>\( \frac{dI}{dt} \) = Rate of change of current</li>
</ul>
<table class="markdownTable">
<tr class="markdownTableHead">
<th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Advantages</b>  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Disadvantages</b>  </th></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">- Excellent linearity and very wide bandwidth <br  />
 - No magnetic core (no saturation) <br  />

<p>Rogowski coils are often used in <b>industrial meters</b> or <b>power quality analyzers</b> where high accuracy and wide dynamic range are needed.</p>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="PowerEnergy"></a>
Power &amp; Energy</h1>
<p>Power and energy measurement combine the sensed voltage and current to compute instantaneous and averaged quantities.</p>
<p>Power computation involves:</p><ul>
<li><b>Instantaneous power:</b> \( p(t) = v(t) \cdot i(t) \)</li>
<li><b>Active power (P):</b> real work done.</li>
<li><b>Reactive power (Q):</b> stored and released energy in inductors/capacitors.</li>
<li><b>Apparent power (S):</b> vector sum of P and Q.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy is obtained by integrating power over time:   </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[    E = \int p(t) \, dt 
\]
</p>
<p>Digital meters perform this discretely by:</p><ol type="1">
<li>Sampling voltage and current.</li>
<li>Computing instantaneous or average power.</li>
<li>Converting to energy per sampling window.</li>
<li>Accumulating energy over time.</li>
<li>Storing (logging) and sharing (displaying/outputting) this data.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Pulse"></a>
Pulse Output (Impulse)</h2>
<p>Many meters include a <b>pulse output</b> (e.g. LED or open collector) proportional to energy consumed.<br  />
 This pulse output rate is a defining feature of a meter and is generally stated on the meters label to enable readouts.<br  />
 This feature is called the <b>Meter Constant</b> and is generally provided in <b>imp/kWh</b>.<br  />
 If a meter has a constant of <em>1000 imp/kWh</em> then for every 1000 pulses, 1kWh has been output - or in other words 1 impulse equals <b>1 Wh</b> (or 3600 Ws) of energy.</p>
<p>Pulse outputs are:</p><ul>
<li>Useful for calibration and verification.</li>
<li>Often used for communication with external monitoring systems.</li>
<li>Typically generated based on active energy accumulation.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Topology"></a>
Topology</h1>
<p>The topology defines how voltage and current sensing channels are connected to measure one or more phases of a system.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="SinglePhase"></a>
Single Phase</h2>
<p>Used in most <b>domestic</b> installations. <br  />
 Measures one phase and neutral pair; both voltage and current are sensed from the same line.<br  />
 The phase is generally tapped of a larger utility three phase supply.</p>

<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="SplitPhase"></a>
Split Phase</h2>
<p>Common in <b>North American</b> systems. <br  />
 Generally created when a utility supply phase (240V) is split using a centre tapped transformer.<br  />
 This provides two 120V "legs" noted in the image as <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, while the centre tap is connected to earth ground.<br  />
 The loads are connected to either leg A or leg B, while larger domestic loads (ovens &amp; washers etc.) are connected to the 240V load.</p>

Three Phase</h2>
<p>Used in <b>industrial and commercial</b> systems. <br  />
 Involves measurement of three phase voltages and currents (generally with a neutral reference). <br  />
 Supports:</p><ul>
<li><b>3-wire (delta)</b> and <b>4-wire (wye)</b> systems (shown below is a wye connection).</li>
<li>Independent per-phase energy accumulation.</li>

<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="MeterTypes"></a>
Meter Types</h1>
<p>Meters are typically classified based on <b>application and current rating</b>.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Domestic"></a>
Domestic</h2>
<p>Designed for residential use, typically up to 100 A per phase. <br  />
 Single-phase or split-phase configurations. <br  />
 Often include communication (e.g. Modbus, M-Bus, or wireless).</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Industrial"></a>
Industrial</h2>
<p>Used in three-phase installations with higher currents and voltages. <br  />
 Support advanced features such as:</p><ul>
<li>Power factor monitoring.</li>
<li>Harmonic analysis.</li>
<li>Demand and load profiling.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="TypicalClassificationLanguage"></a>
Typical Classification Language</h2>
<p>Meters are often marked with a current rating such as <b>230V 5(80)A 50Hz Class 1</b>:</p><ul>
<li>The first value, 230V is the <b>nominal operating voltage</b>.</li>
<li>The second value, 5, is the <b>nominal current</b> (In) which is often the current the meter is calibrated at.<ul>
<li>The value in brackets, 80, is the <b>maximum current</b> (Imax).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The third value 50Hz is the <b>target line frequency</b> for which the meter is calibrated.</li>
<li>The final note, Class 1, is the <b>accuracy classification</b> depending on standard for which compliance is being targetted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the meter is accurate up to 80A, with calibration referenced at 5A, 230V &amp; 50Hz achieving Class 1 accuracy.</p>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Logging"></a>
Logging</h1>
<p>Logging refers to the continuous or periodic storage of measured quantities (e.g. energy, voltage, current, frequency, temperature). <br  />
 For billable meters logging is almost always a legal requirement.</p>
<p>Typical logging requirements include:</p><ul>
<li><b>Energy registers:</b> total active/reactive energy per phase.</li>
<li><b>Load profile:</b> historical demand data.</li>
<li><b>Event log:</b> records of power loss, tamper events, or abnormal conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logging intervals can range from <b>seconds to hours</b>, depending on application requirements and available memory.</p>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Calibration"></a>
Calibration</h1>
<p>Calibration is the process of adjusting the measurement system so that its readings accurately correspond to known reference standards. <br  />
 In AC metering, calibration ensures that measured quantities such as <b>voltage</b>, <b>current</b>, <b>power</b>, and <b>energy</b> align with their true physical values across the meter’s operating range.</p>
<p>Calibration directly affects:</p><ul>
<li><b>Meter accuracy class compliance</b> (e.g. Class 1, Class 0.5, Class 0.2S).</li>
<li><b>Billing correctness</b> and trust in the product.</li>
<li><b>Regulatory certification</b> and long-term stability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="CalibrationProcess"></a>
Calibration Process</h2>
<p>Calibration can be performed during manufacturing or field servicing. <br  />
 It involves injecting known reference signals and adjusting the digital or analog correction coefficients so that the meter reports within tolerance.</p>
<p>Typical calibration stages include:</p><ol type="1">
<li><b>Coefficient Calibration</b> — Apply a precision source with simulated load conditions (e.g. 230 V RMS, 50Hz &amp; 5A) and adjust scaling factors and coefficients for internal sampling chains (V, I, P, Q &amp; S).<ul>
<li><b>Phase angle calibration</b> — Ensure applying UPF (Unity Power Factor) signals so that any phase error present is detected and removed/compensated for internally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Energy integration check</b> — Run a time-based test (e.g. 1 kWh reference load) to confirm cumulative energy accuracy.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="CalibrationMethods"></a>
Calibration Methods</h2>
<p>Meters are often calibrated using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Single-point calibration:</b> <br  />
 Adjusts meter response at one nominal operating point (e.g. 230 V, 5 A, 50 Hz). <br  />
 This is the ideal to save manufacturing costs.</li>
<li><b>Multi-point calibration:</b> <br  />
 Performs calibration at multiple voltage/current levels and frequencies to map linearity and temperature effects. <br  />
 Produces higher accuracy and better performance over the full dynamic range, common in Class 0.5S or better meters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally calibration is done on an automated rig in a high production volume environment where computer-controlled sources &amp; reference meters (0.02% accuracy or better) generate precision load/operating conditions and trigger a calibration across a batch of meters who store the data in non-volatile memory.</p>
<hr  />
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Tampering"></a>
Tampering</h1>
<p>Tampering refers to deliberate or accidental actions that alter a meter’s intended measurement behaviour. <br  />
 Detection and logging of tampering events are crucial for billing accuracy, safety, and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Common types of tampering include:</p><ul>
<li><b>Magnetic interference:</b> applying strong magnets to saturate CT cores or affect magnetic sensors. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Neutral disturbance:</b> disconnecting or reversing the neutral path to influence current flow measurement. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Phase reversal:</b> swapping current transformer polarities or voltage phase wiring to reverse energy direction. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Bypass connections:</b> creating parallel paths around the sensing element (e.g. across shunt or CT secondary). <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Earth tampering:</b> grounding one terminal of the current sensor to manipulate readings or cause leakage. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Firmware/communication tampering:</b> attempting to modify calibration data or meter configuration through communication ports.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="TamperDetection"></a>
Tamper Detection Techniques</h2>
<p>Modern electronic meters incorporate multiple mechanisms to detect and record tampering:</p><ul>
<li><b>Reverse energy flow detection:</b> identifies when power direction is opposite to normal consumption. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Neutral missing detection:</b> compares voltage and current vectors to infer open-neutral conditions. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Magnetic field sensors:</b> detect strong external magnetic fields near the metering enclosure. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Phase angle monitoring:</b> checks for unrealistic shifts between voltage and current vectors. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Cover open / enclosure switch:</b> triggers a hardware input when the meter cover is removed. <br  />
</li>
<li><b>Checksum and signature verification:</b> protects calibration and configuration data against alteration.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a tamper condition is detected:</p><ol type="1">
<li>The event is <b>timestamped</b> and stored in the <b>event log</b>. <br  />
</li>
<li>A <b>flag</b> is raised in the meter’s register or communication frame. <br  />
</li>
<li>Optional <b>relay or pulse output</b> may be inhibited to prevent billing manipulation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="TamperLogging"></a>
Tamper Logging</h2>
<p>All tamper detections should be recorded in non-volatile memory, forming part of the legal metrology record. <br  />
 Logged data typically includes:</p><ul>
<li>Event type (e.g. reverse energy, magnetic tamper, cover open). <br  />
</li>
<li>Date and time of occurrence and restoration. <br  />
</li>
<li>A running count or cumulative duration of tamper events. <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>These logs can be retrieved using protocols such as <b>DLMS/COSEM</b>, <b>Modbus</b>, or proprietary field tools for analysis and audit.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Regulatory bodies (e.g. MID in Europe) require that tamper events <b>cannot be deleted</b> by normal user operation and must persist even after power loss. <br  />
 This ensures traceability and accountability in billing-grade metering systems.</dd></dl>

<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Compliance"></a>
Compliance</h1>
<p>Compliance in AC metering defines the set of <b>standards, directives, and certification requirements</b> that an energy meter must meet to be legally sold or installed in a given market. <br  />
 It ensures the product meets <b>technical performance</b>, <b>safety</b>, <b>electromagnetic compatibility</b>, and <b>accuracy</b> criteria defined by national and international authorities.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>This is not an exhaustive guide, it serves to gather information for reference.<br  />

<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="GlobalStandards"></a>
Global Standards – IEC</h2>
<p>At the highest level, global conformance is defined by the <b>International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)</b> — a non-profit organization responsible for standardizing electrical and electronic systems worldwide. <br  />
 IEC standards define what constitutes a compliant metering device from a <em>technical</em> standpoint and form the foundation upon which regional and national standards are based.</p>
<p>Common IEC standard families relevant to AC metering include:</p>

Regional / Bloc Standards (EU &amp; UK)</h2>
<p>Regions or trade blocs (e.g. EU, UK) translate international standards into <b>legal frameworks</b> that products must comply with to be marketed. <br  />
 These frameworks define <b>requirements</b> — which are then supported by <b>standards</b> that provide the technical means to prove compliance.</p>
<p>Typical compliance hierarchy in the EU/UK:</p>
<table class="markdownTable">
<tr class="markdownTableHead">
<th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Step</b>  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Entity</b>  </th><th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Purpose</b>  </th></tr>

MID / MIR Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>EU MID (Measuring Instruments Directive – 2014/32/EU)</b> <br  />
</li>
<li><b>UK MIR (Measuring Instruments Regulations – 2016)</b> <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>These define the <b>legal framework</b> for electricity meters, specifying what must be tested, documented, and certified. <br  />
 Testing is typically performed per <b>BS EN 50470-1</b> and <b>BS EN 50470-3</b>.</p>
<h3 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="EMC"></a>
EMC Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>EU:</b> EMC Directive 2014/30/EU <br  />
</li>
<li><b>UK:</b> EMC Regulations 2016 <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>While these are general EMC directives, specific test methods come from <b>IEC 61000</b> series standards. <br  />
 Meters are tested for:</p><ul>
<li>Conducted and radiated emissions <br  />
</li>
<li>Electrostatic discharge (ESD) <br  />
</li>
<li>RF immunity <br  />
</li>
<li>Burst and surge resilience <br  />
</li>
</ul>
<p>These tests confirm that the meter operates reliably in realistic electrical environments.</p>

<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="Accuracy"></a>
Accuracy Standards</h2>
<p>Accuracy defines how closely a meter’s measurement corresponds to the true electrical quantity. <br  />
 In the EU and UK, accuracy classes are defined under <b>MID/MIR</b> and <b>EN 50470-3</b>, while globally they trace back to <b>IEC 62053</b>.</p>

Compliance Path (EU/UK)</h2>
<p>To achieve compliance, a typical AC energy meter must be verified against <b>multiple domains of standards</b>:</p>
